<p>Composed of:</p>
<ul>
<li>15 slices in the same 10K steps, to see if having shorter durations and then sampling the assemblages changes our ability to detect structure</li>
<li>Hierarchy with 4 children per level</li>
<li>Root node which can change over time, with 0.2 prob per slice</li>
<li>Very weak links between nodes, except for strong links between lowest level (gchild) nodes</li>
<li>Low innovation rate prior distribution (theta = 0.0005 to 0.001)</li>
<li>Low migration fraction prior distribution (migr = 0.005 to 0.01)</li>
